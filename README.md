# VSCode RLE

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension for the [RLE (Run Length Encoded)](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded) file format.

RLE is one of the most commonly-used file format in the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) community. It is not really human-readable. I just write this extension for fun.
